# Learning-ETL-with-Luigi
Using the Python library Luigi, I build two small data pipelines, then put them in a Docker container.

1. Grabs a ZIP file online, uploads it to a MongoDB database, then extracts some data out
2. Scrapes a website, saves it to a CSV, then pulls interesting data out

It's a simple example good for anyone just starting out. Feedback appreciated.
